# GenDID/data

The data set used here come from the following sources:

Xpert-data-sim.Rda: The data here are derived from the study conducted by Durovni et al. (2013, 2014) and analyzed by Trajman et al. (2015), with re-analysis by Thompson et al. (2018). Sent to Lee Kennedy-Shaffer by the authors, and compiled into current form for use in Kennedy-Shaffer et al. (2020). These data are simulated based on the trial setting and outcomes, but do not correspond to the actual outcomes observed in the trial. For original data accessibility, see Trajman et al. (2015). Lee Kennedy-Shaffer can share code to convert original data to the form used here for those with access to the original data.
