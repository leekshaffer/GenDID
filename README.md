# GenDID

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GenDID is to implement the generalized DID estimator
approach for the analysis of stepped wedge cluster-randomized trials and
observational/quasi-experimental panel data. See the manuscript “A
Generalized Difference-in-Differences Estimator for Randomized
Stepped-Wedge and Observational Staggered Adoption Settings” by Lee
Kennedy-Shaffer at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08730>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GenDID from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("leekshaffer/GenDID")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(GenDID)
## basic example code
```
